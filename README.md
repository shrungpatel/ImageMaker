# ImageMaker
Need to find a motivational image? Just run ImageMaker!

# Future plans
This was something I created during summer break as a proof of concept. I plan on integrating this into the full stack app for quotes in the future. I am still improving on the current prototype right now by finding new images, and fonts.

The quotes right now are not plentiful because I needed them to test, but when it is integrated into the other app, they will be from a proper database. The images are from creative commons.
